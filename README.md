# Promoter

Promoter allows users to pay for premium access to a Skynet portal with various cryptocurrencies. The actual payments
are processed by specialized payment processors
e.g. [siacoin-promoter](https://github.com/SkynetLabs/siacoin-promoter). Promoter converts the fund sent by the user
into credits and allows the user to use their credit balance to pay for specific packages.
